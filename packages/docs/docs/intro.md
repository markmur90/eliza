## What is Eliza?

Eliza is a powerful multi-agent simulation framework designed to create, deploy, and manage autonomous AI agents. Built with TypeScript, it provides a flexible and extensible platform for developing intelligent agents that can interact across multiple platforms while maintaining consistent personalities and knowledge.

## Installation

We offer several installation paths depending on your goal. If you're new to ElizaOS, we recommend starting with the **Install CLI Tool** tab. If you want to contribute to the core project, head to the **Contribute to ElizaOS Core** tab.

For detailed instructions on each path, including configuration options and extended capabilities, see our [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart.md). If you run into any issues, check our [**Frequently Asked Questions**](./faq.md).

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 23+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- Git for version control
- For Windows Users: [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) is required

You can verify your Node.js version with the following command:

```bash
node --version
# Expected output: v23.0.0 or higher
```

If you have a different version, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to switch to the correct version:

```bash
nvm install 23
nvm use 23
```

Eliza offers different paths depending on your goals:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Install CLI Tool (Recommended)" default>

While you can use `npm`, we strongly recommend using `bun` for performance and compatibility with the ElizaOS ecosystem.

```bash
# Recommended: Install via bun (https://bun.sh/)
bun install -g @elizaos/cli

# Alternative: Install via npm
npm install -g @elizaos/cli

# From a folder to install a project
elizaos create
cd new-agent
elizaos start
```

Then visit https://localhost:3000 to interact with your agent through a web interface.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="project" label="Create a Test Project">

```bash
# Create a new project through interactive setup
elizaos create

# Navigate to your project directory
cd my-project-name

# Start your project
elizaos start
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="plugin" label="Add a Custom Plugin">

Add plugins to your project:

```bash
# List available plugins
elizaos plugins list

# Add a plugin
elizaos plugins add @elizaos/plugin-discord

# Create a plugin project
elizaos create --type plugin
```

Develop and test your plugin:

```bash
# Test your plugin
elizaos start

# Publish your plugin when ready
elizaos publish
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="contribute" label="Contribute to ElizaOS Core">

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:elizaOS/eliza.git
cd eliza

# Install dependencies and build
bun install
bun run build

# Start ElizaOS
bun start
```

Visit https://localhost:3000 to interact with your agent through a web interface.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

> If it fails the first time try the start command again

## Available Commands Reference

The `elizaos` CLI is the primary way to interact with your projects and agents. It is organized into several logical command groups:

| Category           | Commands                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Project Management | `create`, `start`, `stop`                       |
| Agent Management   | `agent list`, `agent start`, `agent get`        |
| Development        | `dev`, `test`, `update`                         |
| Configuration      | `env list`, `env edit-local`, `env interactive` |
| Plugin Ecosystem   | `plugins list`, `plugins add`, `publish`        |

For a complete list and detailed explanation of every command, see the [**CLI Overview**](./cli/overview.md).

You can also discover commands directly from your terminal:

```bash
# Get a list of all top-level commands
elizaos --help

# Get help for a specific command group
elizaos agent --help
```
